# Template-Engine-Employee-Summary
## User Story
```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```
## Project Overview
> In this project we built a software engineering team generator command line application. The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. They may be a mix of engineers and interns and managers.
### Challenges
> Something that was very difficult for me was getting to html to render, which makes it lose all functionality.
### Small Wins!
> Although I didn't meet the functionality requirements, I did manage to get all tests to pass and to get obtain user input in ways that I had struggled with before.
